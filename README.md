# Project Title
Car Dealership Management System

## Description of the Project
The Car Dealership Management System is a Java application designed for efficient management of a car dealership's 
inventory and contracts. It allows users to add, view, and search for vehicles by various attributes, as well as manage sales and lease agreements. 
The system connects to a MySQL database for secure and scalable data storage, making it a reliable tool for enhancing dealership operations.

- As a user, I want to search for vehicles by mileage range so that I can find vehicles based on their usage.

- As a user, I want to search for vehicles by type so that I can easily filter by categories like sedan, SUV, or hatchback.

- As a user, I want to be able to add new vehicles to the system so that I can keep the inventory up-to-date and meet customer demands.

- As a user, I want to be able to remove vehicles from the system so that I can keep the inventory accurate and current.
